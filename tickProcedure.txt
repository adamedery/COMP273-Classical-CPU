We have a counter system that cycles through 0 to 8. At the start, it is at 0, and the first tick causes it to be 1. We designate a function at each of those ticks so we may pass data properly.

1. PC sends address to RAM
2. RAM reads data and sends it to MBR. As this is our instruction, it is saved in the IR.
3. Keypad data gets send to the MBR.
4. CPU sends the address (last 4 bits of instruction). This will be used for load/store, but is otherwise useless. The first four bits in the data will hold the following:
	* Is the OP code store
	* Is the OP code print	
	* Is the OP code stop
	* Is there an error in the ALU operation
	This data will be passed to the RAM, Display, and the Reset toggle
5. RAM outputs the data at the address it was previously given. Depending on our instruction, we may choose to save it.
6. CPU outputs data for RAM to write at its current address. If the bit at #4 was write, RAM will save it.
7. CPU outputs data to display. If the second bit at #4 was 1, the display will show it.

Concurrently, the following will happen during certain ticks:

6. We have both the instruction and the new data, so it may be saved into registers if we need it.
7. We have all our data where we need it to be, so ALU operations may be executed.
8. PC will increment if there is no jumping, or set itself to the address to jump to.
